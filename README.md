# Robotic-beetle

You’ll create simple robots that move around on two motorised legs whose vibrations help the robotic critter to go on its merry way. By adding cables, using a screwdriver, soldering and combining different components you will learn about the electric current, see how an engine works, and learn about basic electronics. You’ll create a custom shell for your beetle with a laser cutter.

You’ll get to take your very own robotic beetle home with you after the workshop is concluded.
